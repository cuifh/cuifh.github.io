== About me
I am a Statistics PhD student in University of Texas at Austin. Currently, I am fortunate to work with [https://nhatptnk8912.github.io Prof. Nhat Ho], [https://sinead.github.io Prof. Sinead Williamson] and [https://mingyuanzhou.github.io Prof. Mingyuan Zhou] on some projects about gradient methods, nonparametric learning and optimal transport. I am now interested in Bayesian methods, gradient-based methods, Monte Carlo methods, optimization and machine learning.

Before moving to Austin, I received an M.S. degree in Statistics from [https://www.uchicago.edu University of Chicago] in 2020, and a B.S. degree in Mathematics and Applied Mathematics from [https://www.fudan.edu.cn Fudan University] in 2018.
