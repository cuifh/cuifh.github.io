== About me
I am a Statistics PhD student in University of Texas at Austin. I am fortunate to be advised by [https://web.ma.utexas.edu/users/s.g.walker/ Prof. Stephen G. Walker]. My current research mainly focuses on Bayesian statistics, especially Bayesian nonparametric methods and uncertainty quantification, and generative models. I am also interested in gradient-based methods, Monte Carlo methods, optimization and statistical machine learning.

Before moving to Austin, I received an M.S. degree in Statistics from [https://www.uchicago.edu University of Chicago] in 2020, and a B.S. degree in Mathematics and Applied Mathematics from [https://www.fudan.edu.cn Fudan University] in 2018.

In my free time, I enjoy watching movies, musicals, and traveling. So far, Iâ€™ve explored 23 countries across Asia, Europe, North America, and Africa (wishing for world peace). My favorite band is [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coldplay Coldplay], and my favorite musical is /[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Into_the_Woods Into the Woods]/.
